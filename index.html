<p id="paragraph">Entertainment is a form of activity that holds the attention and interest
 of an audience, or gives pleasure and delight. It can be an idea or a task, but is more likely
 to be one of the activities or events that have developed over thousands of years specifically
 for the purpose of keeping an audience's attention.[1] Although people's attention is held by
 different things, because individuals have different preferences in entertainment, most forms
 are recognisable and familiar. <mark>Storytelling, music, drama, dance, and different kinds of 
performance exist in all cultures</mark>, were supported in royal courts, developed into sophisticated 
forms and over time became available to all citizens. The process has been accelerated in modern
 times by an entertainment industry which records and sells entertainment products.
<a href="#">http://www.wildanimals.com/</a> Entertainment
 evolves and can be adapted to suit any scale, ranging from an individual who chooses a private
 entertainment from a now enormous array of pre-recorded products; to a banquet adapted for two; 
to any size or type of party, with appropriate music and dance; to performances intended for 
thousands; and even for a global audience.</p>
